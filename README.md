# "This is a web application that can monitor the activies or action perfomed by a user on a website real time."
----
It has two types of users, adminstrator and normal user.

# How it works:


- The adminstrator can view the activies that a normal user is perfoming in realtime using socketio library.

- When you open the application the login page is the First page. you enter username and password and then log in if #the credentials are correct. I you dont have an acount your can create an acount"
- 
- An admin will be notofied evertime someone log in to the sysyem. and if you enter wrong credentials for three times, #the admin will be notified via email
